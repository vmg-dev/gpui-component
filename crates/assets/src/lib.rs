/// Embed application assets for GPUI Component.
///
/// This assets provides icons svg files for [IconName](https://docs.rs/gpui-component/latest/gpui_component/enum.IconName.html).
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use gpui::*;
/// use gpui_component_assets::Assets;
///
/// let app = gpui_platform::application().with_assets(Assets);
/// ```
///
/// ## Platform Differences
///
/// - **Native (Desktop)**: Icons are embedded in the binary using RustEmbed
/// - **WASM (Web)**: Icons are downloaded from CDN using web_sys::Request
///   - This significantly reduces WASM bundle size
///   - Icons are downloaded on-demand when first used
///   - Downloaded icons are cached in memory
